## My process

Beginning with the HTML document, i used the BEM(Block, Element and Modifier) metodology for the organization of the markup tags, using the semantic HTML, with the best tags for the necessary style. The block was the `<main>` tag, following the class name "main..." for the elements within the main block, and the only modifier used was in the author name, with the "--emphasis" modifier. The CSS was made following the HTML doc with BEM. Finishing with the media queries for the sizes that was need to update.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

How to use the BEM methodology for a best organized CSS document, separating the elements in respective divisions according to their functions, and naming the classes in the main block;
